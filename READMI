# SunPlot-MATLAB ☀️

This project generates a stylized sun using trigonometric geometry and the `fill()` function in MATLAB.  
It combines artistic creativity and mathematical structure to demonstrate how MATLAB can be used for expressive plotting.

## 💡 What it does

- Plots a yellow central circle as the Sun.
- Generates 12 triangular sun rays positioned evenly around the circle.
- Includes a personalized signature at the bottom.

## 🛠️ How to use

1. Open `sun_plot.m` in MATLAB.
2. Run the script.
3. The figure will display the sun with rays and save an optional image (`sun_plot.png`).

## 📷 Output
